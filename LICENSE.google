By using the Google Maps SDK for iOS you accept Google's Terms of Service and
Policies. Pay attention particularly to the following aspects:

*   Depending on your app and use case, you may be required to display
    attribution. Read more about [attribution requirements](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/intro#attribution_requirements).
*   Your API usage is subject to quota limitations. Read more about [usage
    limits](https://developers.google.com/maps/pricing-and-plans/).
*   The [Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms) are a
    comprehensive description of the legal contract that you enter with Google
    by using the Google Maps SDK for iOS. You may want to pay special attention
    to [section 10](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms#10-license-restrictions),
    as it talks in detail about what you can do with the API, and what you
    can't.
